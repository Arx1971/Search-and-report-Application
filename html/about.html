			<h2><center>Internet and Web Technologies (CSCI 355)</center></h2>
			<h2><center>Summer 2019</center></h2>
			<h2><center>Term Project – Phase 1</center></h2>

			<h3>Introduction: </h3>
			<p>
				The project for the Summer 2019 term is to build a “Search And Reporting Application” (SARA). The project will be implemented in two main phases. The first is to be completed individually. [The second phase, to be described in a separate document, will generally require working in groups. The recommended group size is 4 to 6 students. You should already be forming your groups now...
			</p>
			
			<h3>Overview:</h3>

			<ul>
					<li>
						Create a website which will be used to house SARA, as well as other 	pertinent information (see “Website/Homepage” below).
					</li>
					<li>
						Display search results read from files stored in CSV, JSON, and XML formats.
					</li>
					<li>
						Display search results obtained from using the Google Search API (see e.g. <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview">Google Api</a>)
					</li>

			</ul>

			<p>
				Regardless of the source of the search results (file, Google API, or custom search engine) – the presentation styling should be the same. This should all be controlled using an external stylesheet
				(CSS).
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, each displayed search result should have a checkbox next to it, and users should be able to save whichever search results they have checked to any of the three file types mentioned above. (The standard “Select All” and “Deselect All” options should be provided.) This write feature should be available across all sources of search results.
			</p>

			<h3>Website/Homepage:</h3>
			<p>The home page should have at least the following four high-level menu options.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Course,</strong> 
					with a submenu items pointing to our courseZybook, TopHat, Google Drive, W3Schools.com, and optionally, other resourcesrelevant to our course.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Search,</strong> 
					with submenu items to the various search modes specified in the Overview. This will obviously be the most important functional area of the site.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Browser,</strong> 
					with five submenu items respectively communicating the following attributes.
					<ul>
						<li>Navigator* - appName, product, appVersion, userAgent, platform, 		language
						</li>
						<li>
							Window - inherHeight, innerWidth
						</li>
						<li>
							Screen - width, height, availWidth, availHeight, colorDepth, pixelDepth
						</li>
						<li>
							Location - href, hostname, pathname, protocol
						</li>
						<li>
							Geolocation - Latitude, Longitude
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/">Java Script</a> and scroll down to “JS Browser BOM” in left nav-bar to get ideas as well as relevant code snippets.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>About - </strong>with submenu items to descriptions of the student-developers of the page and a “Contact Us” to contact them by e-mail. (If you don’t want your real email posted, you can create a Mailinator or other emailing alias system that will forward to your real email.)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The website should use “responsive web design” (RWD) – so that it can be easily viewed on mobile devices, as well as on larger screens such as laptops and desktops.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here are some helpful links with regards to menus generally and responsive ones in particular:
