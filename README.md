# Overview:
1. Create a website which will be used to house SARA, as well as other pertinent information (see “Website/Homepage” below).
2. Display search results read from files stored in CSV, JSON, and XML formats.
3. Display search results obtained from using the Google Search API [Google Api](
https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview).

	Regardless of the source of the search results (file, Google API, or custom search engine) – the presentation styling should be the same. This should all be controlled using an external stylesheet (CSS).
	In addition, each displayed search result should have a checkbox next to it, and users should be able to save whichever search results they have checked to any of the three file types mentioned above. (The standard “Select All” and “Deselect All” options should be provided.) This write feature should be available across all sources of search results.
