# Overview:
Create a website which will be used to house SARA, as well as other pertinent information (see
“Website/Homepage” below).
Display search results read from files stored in CSV, JSON, and XML formats.
Display search results obtained from using the Google Search API (see e.g.
https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview)
Phase 2: Display search results from your own search engine which indexes the entire content of
webpages. (Details about the search engine will be provided later in the semesters when we
discuss databases and server-side programming.) Administration screens related to this search
engine will also be needed.
Regardless of the source of the search results (file, Google API, or custom search engine) – the
presentation styling should be the same. This should all be controlled using an external stylesheet
(CSS).
In addition, each displayed search result should have a checkbox next to it, and users should be able
to save whichever search results they have checked to any of the three file types mentioned above.
(The standard “Select All” and “Deselect All” options should be provided.) This write feature should be
available across all sources of search results.
